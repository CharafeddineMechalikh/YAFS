YAFS (Yet Another Fog Simulator) is a simulator tool based on Python of architectures such as: [Fog Computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fog_computing) ecosystems for several analysis regarding with the placement of resources, cost deployment, network design, ... [IoT environments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things) are the most evident fact of this type of architecture.


The **highlights** points of YAFS are:
* **Dinamyc topology:** entities and network links can be created or removed along the simulation.
* **Dinamyc creation of messages sources:** sensors can generate messages from different point access along the simulation.
* And for hence, the **placement allocation algorithm** and **the orchestration algorithm,** that are extended by the user, can run along the simulation.
* The **topology of the network** is based on [Complex Network theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_network). Thus, the algorithms can obtain more valuable indicators from topological features.
* The **results** are stored in a raw format in a nosql database. The simpler the format, the easier it is to perform any type of statistics.

Installation
------------

YAFS requires Python 2.7 (Python 3.6 or above is not supported)

You can download and install YAFS manually:

```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/acsicuib/YAFS
```


Getting started
---------------

The [YAFS tutorial](https://yafs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction/index.html) is a good starting
point for you. You can also try out some of the [Examples](https://yafs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/index.html) shipped with
YAFS but in any case you have to understand the main concepts of Cloud Computing and other related architectures to design and modelling your own model.

To run some folder project you can create a simple bash script, with the following lines (please update the path according with your system):

```bash
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/<your path>/YAFS/src/:src/examples/Tutorial/
python src/examples/Tutorial/main1.py
```


Documentation and Help
----------------------

The [documentation](https://yafs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) contains a [tutorial](https://yafs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction/index.html), the [architecture design](https://yafs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/architecture/index.html) explaining key
concepts, a number of [examples](https://yafs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/index.html) and the [API reference](https://yafs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_reference/index.html).

Improvements
------------
- june / 25 / 2018 Bug Fixed - The DES.src metric of the CSV results is fixed. Identifies the DES-process who sends the message
- june / 20 / 2018 Messages from sources have an unique identifier that is copied in all the transmissions. We can trace each application invocation.
